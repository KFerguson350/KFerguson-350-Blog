The Lone Woman and the Last Indians Digital Archive is a digital humanities project that is focused around the organizing and data collection of over 400 publications related to the story of the Lone Woman of Saint Nicholas Island. From my own knowledge and information gathered from the project itself, the Lone Woman was the sole survivor of her native tribe on an island off the coast of California, living alone for nearly twenty years. This story may be more familiar to this audience, as it was to me, that these are also the events that sparked the writing of the young adult book  _Island of the Blue Dolphins_ by Scott O’Dell. The documents collected in this digital project span the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, even though the events took place between 1835-53. They focus on newspaper articles from all over the world, which emphasises how far her story expanded and how many audiences interpreted her story, and what was later confirmed to be the purpose of the project. 

Upon first glance of the website, I noticed The “Home” page says little to nothing about the significance of, or how to use, the website. It is difficult to understand what one is looking at until you are much deeper into the project. The home page’s use is not clearly understood.

So after the failure of the home page, I cleverly checked the “How To Use This Site” guide, which was one of the links posted on the left hand side of the page, hoping for a little more clarification. I was impressed at first, but unfortunately my next qualm begins with this link. The guide was almost as long-winded as some of the posted articles, which only proved to lead me down a much deeper hole.

The “Interpretive Mode” that I discovered while perusing the “How To” guide I had hoped would help me to begin looking at the articles and trying to understand their involvement in the overall mission of the website. This mode, however, opened another tab entirely, which then said it was actually the “Literary Tropes” page which was further down the left handed list of links. It was within this section that I finally learned that the significance of the website was to show how the lore that surrounds the actual historical event was very much convoluted throughout the retellings in newspaper articles. Ironic, considering how many hoops I had to jump through just to find this explanation. 
 
The project slightly redeemed itself, however, when it came to the maps and interactive features of the website. The “Data Visualizations” page was by far my favorite, and the maps were easy to explore and toy around with. They digitized a nearly incomprehensible amount of newspaper articles, and it would be difficult to browse through all of them (though this is an option). Alternatives for exploring the content are provided, which cannot be denied. 

But the articles provided, as hinted at, came as a double-edged sword. There is an overwhelming amount of content under the “Browse” section, so it would be a lot easier to see visuals and read the tid-bits that came with them rather than dive into all of the articles (as I had hoped the “Data Visualizations” link would succeed at). I do recognize that I did not come to this page with any sort of research question, and it may have been more geared towards that, which would leave me to blame for being overwhelmed and confused. Nevertheless, there was almost no way to summarize the content. 

Visuals were provided in the Maps section, however their biggest flaw (and potentially the biggest flaw of the entire page), is the lack of significance in the pinpoints. Each highlighted region says nothing about the Lone Woman’s story, and only a brief description of the land or city. At this point I was pretty lost and had no easily accessible clarification. Why are these regions important? In summation, what was their importance to the retelling of the Lone Woman’s story? I was left with more questions than when I began.

If the project were to be restructured to be more user-friendly, I would suggest combining the “How To” guide and the home page. Not only would that provide a clearer understanding of the project’s purpose, but it would also show users how to navigate the site as soon as they open it. Furthermore, the information linked on the maps page has no significance to the articles uploaded, so a shortened version of browsing is not currently an option. 

I recognize that my opinion of this digital humanities project is a convoluted one, because no typical user of the website would ever nit-pick to this extreme. However, despite any of my negative commentary, the website successfully collected and digitized information from around the world about this woman’s story, and provided it in a format that is easily accessible, for the most part. That being said, my overall impression of the project is a positive one.
