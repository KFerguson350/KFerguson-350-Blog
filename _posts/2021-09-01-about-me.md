# All About Katherine 

By now you'll notice that my name is plastered all across this webpage, but if you still haven't caught on, I'm Katherine Ferguson. 

I'm just starting my junior year at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu) where I've been lucky enough to double major in English and Psychology, as well as earn a minor in Political Science.

For someone who is all across the board when it comes to classes, you'd think they know what they want to do with their career, right? *Wrong*. 
Thankfully, while I'm figuring out my future, CNU's course requirements have led me to have quite the robust collection of classes under my belt. The newest addition is the course this webpage is dedicated to- _Digital Humanities_

As 1/2 of an English major, I figured that I could handle any sort of writing intensive class that was thrown at me. WHo knew that writing about myself would be one of the hardest homework assignments I've had so far?! (P.S. If you're reading this, I must've done it right!)
I look forward to pushing myself out of my comfort zone and into a whole new world. 

Speaking of my world, on campus I am involved in the social sorority Alpha Sigma Alpha and I am an on-campus employee in the school's counseling center. 

More personally, I am from Charlottesville, Virginia (where UVA is! Go Hoos!) where I've left behind three brothers and two dogs. 

And even though my brothers and I fight like cats and dogs, they are my only desired companions when it comes to world travel, which is one of my _favorite_ things to do! 
So far, my family and I have been to:
+ Iceland
+ England
+ Spain 
+ Jamaica
+ France 
+ Norway 
+ Denmark
+ Scotland
And I would list more if my memory worked better.

Each of these places has led me to a hidden corner of the world where I've seen surreal architecture, food, history, and scenery. By far the most unbelievable of these was the [Blue Lagoon in Iceland](https://www.bluelagoon.com). The springs were heated by volcanos and the hazy blue water left a memory I won't soon forget. 

Traveling and experiencing other cultures first hand is euphoric and exhilarating, and if my professional career ever led me overseas I would be elated.

Unfrotunately, however, I've got to complete my time here at Christopher Newport and earn my degrees (I'm a double major, in case you didn't catch that the first time ;) ). And who knows, by the end of my time here in Digital Humanities I could have a new direction or passion!
