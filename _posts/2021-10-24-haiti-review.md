# An Honest Review of "Haiti and the Atlantic World"
## Second DH Review

### Project Name: Haiti and the Atlantic World
### Project Director: Julia Gaffield, PhD
### Project URL: https://haitidoi.com 

In preparing for my own Digital Humanities project, my class and I have each sought out professional DH pages in order to critique and grow in understanding about useability. For this project, I came across Dr. Julia Gaffield’s page “Haiti and the Atlantic World: Sources and Resources Discussions about Haiti and Haitian History”.

In a sentence, this DH project “seeks to encourage the discussion about Haiti’s founding documents and their influences on the broader Atlantic.” This simplistic description was a direct quote from the website’s About page. Unfortunately, however, that was the _only_ sentence provided in the About page.

However, this project has some really clean pluses that I enjoyed. For starters, whenever you press the title of the website, it takes you back to the Home/About page, which is really nice. Preventing people from getting lost in a website is always a good idea. 

Furthermore, there is a Blog page linked, which is a really unique idea for further discussion on the topics. It already has some linked tweets and other media, so users have another way to comprehend the topics they are learning about.

This is also the second link of the website, so as a whole it flows really well that users can view this page early on.

The next three drop-down menus/links are all in reference to the actual important documents that this webpage is discussing. It has fifteen different drafts of the Haitian constitution, as well as multiple extra documents that aided to the foundation and broader reach. I only wish I had more time to examine them all.

However, I do not speak French/Haitain Creole, which is the language that these documents are written in on the website.

I really appreciated the attention to detail in preserving the documents in their original language, however I only wish I could have understood what some of them said. By creating this Digital Humanities project and limiting its accessibility due to language barriers, it loses some of its range of viewers. 

The DOI page, however, does not have this problem! There is a translation option to translate the entire page. Furthermore, the creator inserts an excerpt from one of her professional essays on the subject. This is where discussion about Haiti’s history and rich explanation of Haiti’s importance as a Latinx country come out. 

And while the essay is a lot of information, if someone was doing research on the subject there are an abundance of resources on this page.

I do have one large criticism with the webpage, however, and that is that there is a lot of unfinished business. In the blog page, there have not been any added posts since 2017, and in multiple other locations there are other reference points saying they have not been updated since 2016. It is just really disappointing to see a DH project that was made really well, but left alone for so long. (See above picture of Blog page to see when it was last updated). Additionally, there are a few mentions of Dr. Gaffield's upcoming book. Her website is linked to the project, and I learned that her books were published in 2016 and 2017. 

And while this is frustrating, in summation, this DH project definitely spurred some ideas for things I wanted to include in my own. It had a lot of information presented in a very organized manner, and to its credit, upheld the original language and writing of the documents. It was very enjoyable to review.
