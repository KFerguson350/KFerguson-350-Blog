# What Digital Humanities Means to Me 
## An Amatuer's Relfection 

Back in August of 2021, when I first was introduced to the world of Digital Humanities (DH) through an eponynous class, I found myself unequivicolly confused. At the time, I could barley grasp what the humanities were, much less understand what the digital version entailed. This is expressed through my initial Tweets about the class, in which I mentioned how the required readings left much of the understanding of DH to the reader.
