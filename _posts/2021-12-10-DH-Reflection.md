# What Digital Humanities Means to Me 
## An Amatuer's Relfection 

Back in August of 2021, when I first was introduced to the world of Digital Humanities (DH) through an eponymous class, I found myself unequivocally confused. At the time, I could barely grasp what the humanities were, much less understand what the digital version entailed. This is expressed through my initial Tweets about the class, in which I mentioned how the required readings left much of the understanding of DH to the reader.

As the course went on and my classmates and I were exposed to more examples of what qualified under the Digital Humanities umbrella, I began to anchor what my definition of this discipline was. At first, I believed that the digital humanities were another word for “media”, meaning any information posted on the internet qualified. After our first assigned review of a DH project, however, I began to realize that DH required an _interactive_ element. 

The interaction between viewer, creator, and information is the core of DH. While this is still very broad and hard to define, I feel as though that is the point. The digital age is evolving before our eyes, and academia is trying to keep up. The Digital Humanities community is leading the exploration of what digital media can do for the good of society as we progress. 

Digital Humanities really “hit home” for me when my class was assigned to make a project of our own. The prompt was to make an interactive map of our school, Christopher Newport University, and include personal anecdotes about our time here. Marked by pinpoints, I was able to tell my story to the world and include my own work into the world of DH. The map is linked below!

Furthermore, the class had assigned readings each week that aided in our understanding. Though they varied in composition, each reading had assigned Twitter posts on our class accounts where we could interact with our classmates. Using Twitter as a discussion forum not only made me more comfortable with the app, but also was an easy way to see my classmates’ individual thoughts even if they were not brought up in class. 

The readings themselves were especially helpful when it came to writing these blog posts. I for one have never had a blog before, and blog etiquette was something that I struggled with. In my reviews, I had a difficult time constructing my tone so I was not too critical or colloquial. I am still working on those skills even as this final blog post is uploaded, however the readings aided me in understanding what an outside audience is looking for when they come to my page. 

Reading styles, paragraph length, picture content, and cleanliness of the blog are just a few examples if things I have read about and actively tried to implement into my blog this semester. 

As a student, this course and Digital Humanities has sincerely helped me grow. I am double majoring in English and Psychology, and I would recommend a course in DH to anyone in either discipline. As an English major, I previously stated some of the ways I have grown in my writing, but specifically with my class here at CNU I was able to do frequent peer review on my content. In my higher-level English classes, peer review is almost obsolete as we are expected to be confident in our own work. However, peer review on even the simplest of writing projects can show the author things that they missed. In fact, pieces of this final blog post were sent to classmates to gain feedback. 

Dually, as a Psychology major, this course has been an insight into people. Writing and creating content for an audience, as well as critiquing from an audience’s perspective, allows me to “flex my psychology muscles” so to speak and aim to understand my own thought processes/the thought processes of others. 

My majors worked in tandem for our final project of the semester and my favorite project that I have worked on in a long time. The prompt was to mockup a grant proposal for a fictitious DH project. My group and I quickly became enumerated with our proposal idea, and if any of us had the resources we would have attempted to bring it to life after the fact. 

My group wanted to focus on people and personal stories and decided to create a world map that would combine tradition, heritage, and expansion of Latinx culture. Writing each piece of the proposal and conducting our research was prompted by our own motivation and drive to create something unique. If our project was real, we felt as though it was something that had never been done before and would have benefitted a community like never before. 

In finishing this class, it is that feeling of drive and motivation that I believe is the true essence of Digital Humanities. It is personal to each creator and viewer, and is an interactive piece of media that can span space and time.
