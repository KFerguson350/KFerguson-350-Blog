# All About Katherine 

By now you'll notice that my name is plastered all across this webpage, but if you still haven't caught on, my name is Katherine Ferguson. 
I'm just starting my junior year at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu), where I've been lucky enough to double major in English and Psychology, as well as earn a minor in Political Science.


For someone who is all across the board when it comes to classes, you'd think they know what they want to do with their career, right? *Wrong*.
